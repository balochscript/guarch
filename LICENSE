1. DEFINITIONS

   "Software" means the Guarch Protocol Suite source code,
   documentation, binaries, and all associated files in this
   repository.

   "Derivative Work" means any software that incorporates,
   modifies, extends, or is substantially based on the
   Software's source code, architecture, protocol
   implementations, or cryptographic handshake sequences.

   "Sell" means to distribute the Software or a Derivative
   Work itself as a paid product, charging users for access
   to the software, its binaries, or its source code.

   "Ancillary Services" means services built around the
   Software that do not involve selling the Software itself,
   including but not limited to: selling server
   configurations, hosting proxy servers, providing managed
   VPN/proxy services, offering technical support, or
   distributing configuration files.


2. GRANTED RIGHTS

   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
   person obtaining a copy of the Software, to:

   a) Use the Software for any purpose — personal,
      educational, research, or commercial infrastructure.

   b) Study, modify, and adapt the Software without
      restriction.

   c) Fork the Software and create independent or competing
      projects based on it, subject to the conditions in
      Section 3.

   d) Distribute the Software or any Derivative Work,
      subject to the conditions in Section 3.

   e) Provide Ancillary Services using the Software,
      including selling server configurations, hosting
      services, managed proxies, and technical support.
      These activities are explicitly permitted and are
      not restricted by this license.


3. CONDITIONS

   The following conditions apply to all copies,
   distributions, forks, and Derivative Works:

   a) ATTRIBUTION — Any Derivative Work, fork, or project
      that uses substantial portions of the Software's
      source code or its novel implementations (including
      but not limited to: the cover traffic system, adaptive
      traffic shaping, smart padding, traffic interleaving,
      decoy server architecture, and probe detection
      mechanisms) MUST include the following acknowledgment:

        "Powered by Guarch"

      This acknowledgment must be:

        - Clearly visible to the end user within the
          application (for example: in the "About" screen,
          footer, settings page, startup screen, or any
          equivalent location where a typical user will
          see it during normal use)
        - Present in the project's README file or primary
          documentation

      No additional names, phrases, or links are required
      beyond "Powered by Guarch". Including a link to the
      original repository is appreciated but not mandatory.

   b) COPYRIGHT NOTICE — This license and the above
      copyright notice must be included in all copies or
      substantial portions of the Software.

   c) NO SELLING THE SOFTWARE — You may NOT Sell the
      Software or any Derivative Work. This means you
      cannot charge users money to obtain, download, or
      access the software, its source code, or its
      compiled binaries.

      For clarity, the following are NOT considered selling
      and ARE permitted:
        - Selling server configurations and config files
        - Charging for hosted proxy/VPN service that runs
          the Software
        - Charging for technical support or setup services
        - Distributing the Software as part of a free
          product while charging for unrelated services
        - Accepting voluntary donations

   d) CHANGES — Any Derivative Work must clearly indicate
      what modifications were made compared to the
      original Software.


4. CLARIFICATIONS

   a) COMPETING PROJECTS — You ARE permitted to fork this
      Software and create an independent or competing
      project, provided you comply with the attribution
      requirements in Section 3(a). Innovation and
      competition are encouraged.

   b) INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENTATIONS — You ARE permitted to
      independently reimplement the protocols, concepts,
      or ideas described in this project's documentation
      from scratch without using any of the Software's
      source code. Such clean-room implementations are
      NOT Derivative Works and are not bound by this
      license. Crediting Guarch as inspiration is
      appreciated but not required.

   c) ANCILLARY SERVICES — Providing commercial services
      around the Software (server hosting, config selling,
      managed services, support) is explicitly permitted
      and does not constitute selling the Software.


5. TERMINATION

   Violation of any condition in Section 3 automatically
   and immediately terminates all rights granted under
   this license. Rights may be restored only by explicit
   written permission from the copyright holder.
